Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles methods and tools in the development and maintenance of high-quality systems. More subtly, this involves the design, development, testing and maintenance of software products.
Software Engineering is important modern technology as it enables tech-users to develop and implement software that cater to different human needs and operational demands hence making work or processes easier.


**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**

Three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include the development of programming languages, establishment of software engineering as a disciple and the rise of agile methodologies in early 21st century.

**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**

The Phases of Software Development Cycle include:
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: this is the creation of detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: the writing of code and building of software based on the definitions made during the requirement and design phase.
Testing: this is the process of conducting tests to ensure the software meets its intended needs and quality standards.
Deployment: releasing the software for use by its users
Maintenance -  regular support, updates and enhancements of the software after deployments.


**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**
The waterfall model adopts a waterfall-like print with distinct phases flowing downwards, while the agile model incorporates iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to changes.
Waterfall model is suitable for cases where phases are predetermined and few change swill be needed like in creating a payroll system while agile is suitable for cases where there is need for incremental changes like in a new mobile app where the user will propose frequent changes.


**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**

A software developer is responsible for writing codes and implementing the software, while a Quality Assurance Engineer ensure that the software is developed and implemented within the quality demands. A project manager on the other hand oversees the planning, execution and delivery of projects.

**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**

Integrated Development Environment (IDEs) allows software developers and engineers to write, debug and test code. Examples include visual studio and eclipse.
Version Control Systems (VCS) also software engineers to track changes to source code and coordinate work among team members, examples include GIT and subversion.


**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**

Examples of challenges faced by software engineers include:
Changing requirements during software development leading to scope creep.
Tight deadlines that pressure the developers to deliver software within constricted environments
Technical Debt which arises from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions.
These challenges can be handled by using effective communication, agile methodology and prioritization of tasks.


**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**

The different types of testing are explained below:
Unit Testing: testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: testing between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: testing the entire system
Acceptance Testing: testing the software against user requirements


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts or messages to get the best responses out of AI models.
Prompt engineering allows users to creates clear and specific prompts that make sure the AI models understand exactly what the user needs.


**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**

Vague prompt “List examples of past presidents.”
Improved prompt “Provide a list of past presidents in Kenya, in chronological order.”
The first prompt provides a general request which the AI can answer using any country and, in any order, available. But the second prompts allow the AI to understand the regional context to be used and further the criteria upon which to list the presidents.
